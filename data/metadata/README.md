Required team evidence:

| Record | Minimum contents | Owner/gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source_manifest.csv | S1/freeze ID, requested/resolved URL, retrieval UTC, release, archive/member bytes and SHA-256, storage/access owner, rights/citation and approval. | Governance / G1 |
| data_dictionary.csv | Actual field/type/unit, valid values, null/sentinel policy, meaning, target/feature/ID role, availability time and curated mapping. | Governance + Engineer / G1–G2 |
| source_to_output.csv | Requirement, S1 field, transformation, K/D/AC/DT link, supported/blocked state and reason. | BA + Governance / G1 |
| cohort_ledger.csv | Raw file/sheet/row ID, mutually exclusive retain/exclude/quarantine state, reason and freeze. | Engineer / G2 |
| metric_lineage.csv | K1–K7 raw fields, formula/code/output, population, denominator/unit/grain, missing policy and test/reviewer. | Domain specialist / G2 |
| evaluation_manifest.csv | Split/group/resample IDs, seed/order, predictor allowlist, target mapping, timing audit and policy lock version. | Modelling analyst / G2–G3 |

**Grain:** One historical credit record identified by original row number; not a modern applicant population.

**Fields:** All original German-coded columns, with kredit target mapped using codetable.txt/read_SouthGermanCredit.R; preserve original→English mapping; verified kredit=0 bad, 1 good; model positive event=1−kredit..

**Evaluation:** Stratified 60/20/20 split seed 34 with duplicate feature groups together; fit encoder, imputation and scaling only on train. Target risk event=bad credit, explicitly verified from original code table. Exclude kredit and identity fields; compare sensitive-field exclusions without asserting fairness from sparse groups. Verified mapping: kredit=0 bad and kredit=1 good; derive bad_event=1−kredit.

Use UTF-8 metadata, ISO dates and UTC retrieval times. Keep sensitive/raw contents and credentials out of logs; use IDs/hashes, and defanged security examples. Exact row accounting and seven-KPI lineage are mandatory. Team approval remains pending until executed; checked source references do not establish completed team analysis.

# MTL-XF-034 — Business context

This is a simulated confidential-client engagement using public/open data. Stakeholders and commercial/security scenarios are fictional. Do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational deployment or realised benefits. This master pack specifies work to be completed; it does not claim the team has executed it.

## Organisation and problem

Confidential Consumer Lender is the fictional organisation. Credit risk leaders need a transparent way to compare risk screening policies and review burdens. An old, deliberately sampled credit dataset can support a learning exercise, but cannot establish modern population default rates, calibrated lending probabilities or a production approval policy.

The Head of Credit Risk needs a credit model risk and policy review supporting **Recommend a human-reviewed risk-screening prototype and identify evidence required before any modern lending pilot.**

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Decision | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head of Credit Risk | Approve scope, policy assumptions and next investigation/pilot. | D7 policy comparison, D11 recommendations, workload/risk and limitations. |
| Credit Risk Analyst | Interpret observations and own action proposals. | K1–K7, source-supported dimensions, sensitivity and case lineage. |
| Data Governance Analyst | Approve source, freeze and interpretation rights. | S1 manifest, licence, actual schema and source-to-output support. |
| Operations / service owner | Accept workload and review/escalation responsibilities. | Action register, eligibility, owners, review dates and override reasons. |
| Credit Model Risk Analyst | Challenge correctness and release readiness. | DT1–DT10, UAT, reconciliations and clean rerun. |

## Workflow to improve

Current simulated process: separate extracts/headline totals → informal prioritisation → manual review with limited lineage. This is a teaching scenario, not an observed real client process.

Proposed process: acquire approved bytes → validate/freeze → curate at declared grain → calculate K1–K7 → compare policies → inspect uncertainty/exclusions → sponsor approves investigation/pilot → record disposition and review date. No score bypasses human approval.

## Questions to answer

1. What is the baseline sample bad-credit share, and what defines its denominator?
2. Which supported groups/cases account for bad-credit recall, and with what sample support?
3. Which cases change between the baseline and alternative, and why?
4. How do the specified transformation, threshold, cost or capacity alternatives alter the decision?
5. Which recommendations remain unsupported and what evidence must be collected next?

## Decision and action evidence

Baseline constant-majority prediction and transparent logistic model; compare validation-selected thresholds under false-negative:false-positive cost ratios 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1. Lock threshold before test. Keep all outcomes as simulated review/referral, not loan approvals.

Every action record contains case/group key, snapshot, observed measure, eligibility, baseline and alternative rank/policy, evidence link, uncertainty, proposed next step, accountable owner, due/review date, disposition and override rationale. Use source-row IDs; do not invent real customer identities.

## Value and limits

Delivery success is evidence-backed acceptance of D1–D12, not guaranteed model superiority. Benefits remain hypotheses until an approved pilot specifies population, comparator, outcome window and guardrails. D11 includes three next actions and a case where the evidence does not justify action.

Do not use Statlog coding. Sex cannot be reliably recovered from famges. Monetary amounts are transformed historical DM and are not actual current exposure. Sample prevalence is not a population default estimate. Audit age and foreign_worker implications; no automated approval/denial or compliance certification.

**Risk to prevent:** Wrong target coding or interpreting oversampled historical outcomes as current default probabilities would invalidate underwriting conclusions.

**Source boundary:** All 1,000 original SouthGermanCredit.asc records with the corrected code table and reader; preserve source sampling and coding. Historical 1973–1975 data; bad credits are oversampled.

Missing mandatory support blocks G1 or a dependent output until a governed scope/source decision is recorded.
